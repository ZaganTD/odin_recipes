            <li> Time Required: 45Min</li>
            <li>Servings: 8</li>
        </ul>    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 (7.5 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 8 muffin cups with cooking spray.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>In a bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and the white sugar until evenly blended. Remove the biscuits from the packages, and cut into quarters. Drop a few biscuit pieces at a time into the sugar mixture, and coat thoroughly. Distribute the coated biscuit pieces among the prepared muffin tins (4 to 5 pieces per cup).</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Place butter, brown sugar, and the remaining 1 tablespoon cinnamon in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl, and microwave a few seconds until the butter has melted. Stir to blend, and drizzle about 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture over each cup.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the muffins are crispy and brown, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before removing from pan.</p>
