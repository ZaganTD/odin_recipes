# odin_recipes
This is the first project in the odin curriculum and also my first "formal" project in web development. This project will probably test my <del>sanity</del> html skills extensively, like using the appropriate elements, attributes, embedding links and images, writing good commit messages and file organizational skills.
I am quite excited to finally be building a proper website, even if it has no design whatsoever.

Correction, i am adding design to it.
